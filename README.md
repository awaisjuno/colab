Colab Microservice Architecture Framework

Colab is a conceptual PHP-based micro-framework designed around microservice architecture principles and inspired by cloud-native application development patterns.

It provides a lightweight, modular, and scalable structure to build modern applications whether monolithic in nature or broken into services. Colab focuses on separation of concerns, code readability, and extensibility, allowing developers to build applications the right way from the ground up.
